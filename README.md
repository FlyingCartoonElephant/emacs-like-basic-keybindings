# emacs-like-basic-keybindings

These are the short list of keybindings for sublime text that are similar to those of Emacs.

- Ctrl+f for moving one char forward
- Ctrl+b for moving one char backward
- Ctrl+/ for undoing
- Ctrl+y for yanking (pasting)
- Ctrl+n for moving to next line
- Ctrl+p for moving to previous line
- Ctrl+a for moving to beginning of the current line
- Ctrl+e for moving to end of the current line
- Alt+f for moving one word forward
- Alt-b for moving one word backward
- Ctrl+s for saving the file ( Ctrl+x+s (emacs command) interferes with the cut command in the sublime text)
- Ctrl+r for replacing
- Ctrl+o for opening a new file

## How to add these keybindings to your sublime text editor?

Copy all the text from the _Default (Linux).sublime-keymap_ file and paste it in your sublime keybindings file.

These keybindings are not for people looking for a true emacs experience in sublime text.
This one only provides basic word and char movements, replacing text and opening and saving files.
If you want more emacs experience in your sublime text, you should probably take a look at [E-Max](https://github.com/glyph/E-Max). However, if you are looking only for basic emacs keybindings (default sublime keybindings are terrible!), then this one is for you.
